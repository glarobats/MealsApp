The Meals App utilizes data provided by the web service https://themealdb.com/api.php. The themealdb provides these services through REST (Representational State Transfer) web services, so they can be used by any interested party. The data returned is in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. The Meals App processes this data to provide corresponding services to its users.

The Meals App has a range of features that can be customized to the user's preferences. It calls the API (Application Programming Interface) without using a key and receives the data in JSON format from the corresponding web service, depending on the user's choices. The capabilities it offers to the user include:

Search for a meal by name.
a) Save the meal to the Database
b) Edit and save the meal to the Database
c) Delete the meal from the Database
d) Display a list of meals by category.
e) View meal statistics.
f) Display in "Pie Chart" option
g) Display in "Bar Chart" option
h) Print statistics to a PDF file.
i) Exit.


The main goal of the project is to design a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) that will allow the user to easily navigate through the application and manage the desired information with clear options. Creating a user interface through a graphical environment with appropriate icons achieves immediate understanding of the application's functions, while providing the user with quick and easy access to data and information they seek.

The graphical environment includes appropriate icons for proper navigation within the application, as well as informational and confirmation messages regarding the execution of critical actions.
